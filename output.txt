Brexit Research Summary:

Brexit, which combines the words "Britain" and "Exit", marked the United Kingdom's historic withdrawal from the European Union. This significant event occurred officially at 23:00 GMT on January 31, 2020. The UK had been a member of the EU and its predecessor organizations since January 1, 1973, and became the first full member state to leave the union.

Key aspects:
- Official withdrawal: January 31, 2020
- Previous membership: Since January 1, 1973
- Historic significance: First member state to fully withdraw from EU
- Legal implications: EU law no longer has primacy over British laws
- Retained framework: The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 keeps relevant EU law as domestic law

The UK maintains various treaty obligations with EU member states and the EU itself, though it now has the power to amend or repeal previously established EU laws that were incorporated into domestic legislation.
